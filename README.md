   - Navigate through different sections

3. **Upload X-ray Images**
   - Select a patient from the dropdown
   - Upload X-ray image (drag & drop or browse)
   - Choose body part and priority level
   - Add clinical notes if needed

4. **AI Analysis**
   - Images are automatically analyzed upon upload
   - View real-time analysis results
   - Review diagnosis, confidence score, and recommendations

5. **Patient Management**

## AI Model Integration

The platform integrates with a pre-trained pneumonia detection model (`pneumonia.h5`). The AI analysis includes:

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize to 224x224 pixels
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Convert to RGB format

2. **Model Prediction**
   - Load pre-trained CNN model
   - Run inference on preprocessed image
   - Generate confidence score

3. **Result Interpretation**
   - Determine diagnosis based on confidence threshold
   - Generate clinical findings
   - Provide treatment recommendations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Database Configuration
The default configuration uses SQLite for development. For production, update `settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'deepxray_db',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
